# Housing-Prices
## In this exercise I will present to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to  price relation with the number of bedroom.
## Imagine that house pricing is as easy as:

## A house has a base cost of 50k, and every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k. This will make a 1 bedroom house cost 100k, a 2 bedroom house cost 150k etc.
